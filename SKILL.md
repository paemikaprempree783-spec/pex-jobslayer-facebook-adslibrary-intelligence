# Facebook Ads Library Strategy Intelligence

## Mission
Turn public Meta Ad Library observations into a defensible **decision memo**, not a list of ads or invented performance claims. Separate what is visible from what is inferred, identify the business decision, and convert uncertain conclusions into tests.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Public Library data is not account data.** Do not claim spend, impressions, reach, CTR, CPC, CPA, ROAS, conversion rate, audience targeting, or winner status unless the source explicitly provides it.
2. Label every material statement as **FACT**, **SIGNAL**, **BET**, or **GAP**.
3. Ads Library presence means an ad was/ is discoverable; it does not prove effectiveness, profitability, or intentional funnel stage.
4. Do not infer personal attributes, sensitive targeting, or exact buying strategy from copy alone.
5. Never score an ad as “high-performing” from longevity, visibility, reactions, or creative quality. Use **study priority** instead.
6. Record source URL, access date, country, platform filters, active-status filter, and sample limits.
7. If the page is blocked, dynamic, incomplete, or requires login, state `เข้าถึงแหล่งข้อมูลไม่ได้` and analyze only verified material.
8. Do not copy competitors' protected creative or make deceptive claims. Recommend principles and tests, not imitation.

## First move: capture the decision
Classify the request before collecting ads:

- **Market/positioning:** What promise or customer situation should we prioritize?
- **Creative system:** Which hooks, proof types, formats, or offers should we test?
- **Funnel:** How might the advertiser move people from attention to action?
- **Competitive response:** What should we do differently or defend against?
- **Monitoring:** What changed since the previous snapshot?

If the user asks for “everything,” follow: `Decision → Source scope → Ad inventory → Evidence map → Pattern analysis → Study priorities → Tests → Measurement`.

## Workflow

### 1. Define source scope
Parse the URL and log:

- advertiser/page and page ID when available
- country/region and language
- active/inactive status, platform, date filters
- access date/time
- requested sample size and actual sample size
- whether results are complete or partial

Do not silently broaden filters. If the user gives only a page URL, ask for the intended country/status or proceed with a clearly stated default.

### 2. Build an ad inventory
For each distinct ad, create one record. Deduplicate by Library ID; do not treat placements or repeated cards as separate ads.

Capture only visible fields:

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Library ID and direct link | Required when visible |
| Advertiser/page | Required |
| Start date / active status | Required when visible |
| Format | Video, image, carousel, text, unknown |
| Platforms | Only those explicitly shown |
| Primary text / headline / CTA | Transcribe or summarize faithfully |
| Offer/mechanism/proof | Visible evidence only |
| Destination | URL, message, lead form, app, unknown |
| Creative angle | Coded category plus evidence |
| Notes | Missing data, ambiguity, duplicate risk |

Direct link format: `https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=[LIBRARY_ID]`.

### 3. Code each ad without overclaiming
Use controlled labels:

- **Situation:** pain, aspiration, event, comparison, education, entertainment, unknown
- **Promise:** functional, emotional, identity, price/promotion, proof-led, unknown
- **Proof:** testimonial, demonstration, authority, guarantee, numbers, UGC, none visible
- **CTA:** learn, message, sign up, shop, download, contact, no visible CTA
- **Journey hypothesis:** cold attention, problem education, consideration, conversion, retention, unknown
- **Offer:** product/service, lead magnet, consultation, discount, event, content, unknown

Journey stage is always a **BET** unless the destination or copy makes it directly observable.

### 4. Construct the evidence map
Use this table before giving recommendations:

| Finding | Label | Source/evidence | Confidence | What would change it? |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Confidence is qualitative: high, medium, low. Do not convert confidence into a fake probability.

### 5. Analyze patterns
Analyze at the level supported by the sample:

- **Message system:** recurring situations, promises, objections, proof, offers, CTAs
- **Creative system:** format and angle variation; signs of iteration, not performance
- **Funnel hypotheses:** how ads may connect to a next step
- **Positioning:** category, audience situation, differentiated mechanism, proof strategy
- **Temporal signals:** new launches, persistent themes, seasonal/event context
- **Portfolio design:** concentration vs exploration across angles and formats

If percentages are used, show the denominator and say `ในตัวอย่างที่เก็บได้`; never generalize to the whole advertiser when the inventory is partial.

### 6. Rank study priorities, not winners
Use **Study Priority** with three qualitative dimensions:

- **Learning value:** how clearly the ad reveals a reusable strategic principle
- **Business relevance:** how closely it relates to the user's offer and decision
- **Evidence quality:** how much of the claim is directly visible

Rank as High/Medium/Low and explain why. A long-running ad can be a useful signal of persistence, but not proof of success. Do not use a numeric 7/10 threshold unless the user supplies valid performance data.

### 7. Convert insights into test cards
Offer 1–3 high-leverage experiments. Change one major variable at a time when causal learning matters.

Each test must specify:

- Bet and supporting evidence
- Change and holdout variables
- Audience/journey and destination
- Primary metric tied to the decision
- Guardrail metric
- Attribution/time window
- Read rule and next move

### 8. Produce the decision memo
Use the structure in `templates/decision-memo.md`. Keep analysis and evaluation visibly separate:

- **📊 Analysis:** directly observed or source-grounded
- **⭐ Evaluation:** interpretation, implication, or recommendation

## Quality gates
Before finalizing, verify:

- The decision is explicit.
- Source scope and sample limits are stated.
- Every major conclusion has FACT/SIGNAL/BET/GAP status.
- No hidden performance, spend, targeting, or ROI claims were invented.
- Direct links exist for every cited ad.
- Missing fields are marked unknown, not zero.
- Recommendations connect to the user's offer and sales path.
- Tests include metrics, guardrails, and read rules.
- The report distinguishes advertiser strategy hypotheses from proven outcomes.

## Response modes

- **Summary:** decision, 3–5 evidence-backed findings, 1–3 actions, open gaps.
- **Detailed:** full inventory, coding table, evidence map, pattern analysis, priorities, test cards.
- **Comparison:** normalize scope and dates first; compare message/creative/offer systems, not unverifiable performance.
- **Monitoring:** compare snapshots by Library ID, start date, message, offer, format, and status; explicitly list additions, removals, and unchanged ads.

## Ask at most three high-impact questions
Ask only when the missing answer would change the recommendation: target country/status, user's offer and business goal, and whether performance/export data exists. Otherwise proceed with stated assumptions.
